# simplylight - Bloomy bulb edition
This fork is meant to be used alongside with my [texture pack](https://github.com/Mpaxlamitsounas/ShaderTech-Simply-Light) that adds bloom using GregTech CEu. Unfortunately the way the bulb is written doesn't allow for bloom without a tiny change, so I made the tiny change.

People looking to build the 1.12 version of simplylight can clone this repo and keep only the buildscript changes, as the base repo doesn't build. Many thanks to the GTCEu team for also making the buildscript.
